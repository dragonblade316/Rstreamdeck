# Rstreamdeck

Rstreamdeck is a lightweight streamdeck controller app built with rust.

## So far it supports:
- toml configuration.
- icons and rgb button control.
- basic shell commands.

## In the works:
- button text (need to figure out fonts)
- ipc based plugin system
- profiles
- streamdeck XL support (I dont have a way to test it though)
