# Rstreamdeck

Rstreamdeck is a modular streamdeck client built with rust.

It is currently in alpha as it is still unstable and needs a lot of stuff fixed. 

## So far it supports:
- toml configuration.
- rendering icons and text.
- running shell commands.
- ipc based plugin system

## In the works (needed before I can call it stable):
- finishing the plugin protocol (it works but is missing features such as button position information)
- documentation
- rendering glitch fixes
- home manager module
- streamdeck XL support (I don't have a way to test it though) 
- adding multiple streamdeck support
- proper logging
- remove all the annoying print statements peppered through the code
- general cleanup
- add cli tooling to assist in making configs
- fix the startup config
- obs plugin
- twitch plugin? (what would this even do that the obs plugin does not)
- keyboard macros

## I might make someday:
- gui configuration
- multithreading
